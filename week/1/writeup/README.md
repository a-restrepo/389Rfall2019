### Part 2 (75 pts)

I think you should tell your boss and suggest to start the team to fix the problems. If your boss doesn't give it the necessary importance, I think you should tell
a consumer watchdog. I think the best course of action would be to fix it fast and quietly. It might not necessarily be ethical to have a car on the market knowing
it has a security flaw in the ECU but one could say that every system has vulnerabilities. In this case at least we know what the vulnerabilities are so we can fix
them. I would not want to tell the public at first because people with bad intentions would be able to exploit the vulnerabilities. It's true that many people would
stop driving the car if the security flaws were made public but we can assume that a lot of people wouldn't. Some people would never hear about the vulnerability,
other people would not care and other people have no other method of transportation. The cars could be recalled but depending on the number of cars it could really
damage the company. I would tell a consumer watchdog after the first accident caused by the security problems or if the company is not willing to fix it but it
might not be worth it to tell them before. If I do nothing, I think I would be somewhat responsible for any harm that results but not entirely because as a consumer
you know there's not a 100 percent garantee that your car's system won't fail in some way because every system can fail.
